# Human-Resource-Machine-Solutions
Contains my solutions from the video game "Human Resource Machine."

## Legend
All source files were put into the same placed in the same directory because it was the most convienent way to handle them. Files are named in the format of "<Room Number><Room Name>[Optimization Indicator]", all lower case and seperated with underscores. Some rooms may have multiple solutions and use the Optimization Indicator to tell whether the solution is optimal and whether is focuses on the amount of instructions (size) or reduced instruction calls (speed) optimization. For files with no Optimization Indicator, they are most likely optimized for both speed and size.
Files use the extension '.s' due to HRM acting like an assembly language.

## How to Use
Human Resource Machine utilizes the clipboard within game to allow users to copy and paste within the program spaces provided or outside the game.
To use these solutions, you can copy from a file into your clipboard, open the game, go to a level, and then press "paste" at the bottom of any of the programs.
